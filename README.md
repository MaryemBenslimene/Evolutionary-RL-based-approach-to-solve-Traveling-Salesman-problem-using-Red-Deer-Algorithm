# Evolutionary-RL-based-approach-to-solve-Traveling-Salesman-problem-using-Red-Deer-Algorithm

In this project, we present an evolutionary reinforcement learning (ERL) approach that combines an EA with a DRL framework to solve a traveling salesman problem. Our approach optimizes the policy generated by the deep neural network, as actor weights are crucial in non-policy methods. Using an Red Deer Algorithm, we can generate a population of weights and feed them into the DRL framework to achieve better results for the TSP.
